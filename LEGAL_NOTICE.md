# Legal Notice & Disclaimer

**Effective Date:** 2026-01-19

## 1. No Legal Advice
**FairProp AI is an automated compliance screening tool, not a law firm or legal service.**

The information, analysis, and reports provided by this software are for **informational and pre-screening purposes only**. They do not constitute legal advice, legal opinion, or a definitive statement of compliance with the Fair Housing Act (FHA), state housing laws, or international regulations.

## 2. Tool Limitations (Screening Only)
FairProp AI uses heuristic rules, keyword matching, and probabilistic AI models to identify *potential* risks. 
- **False Positives**: The tool may flag compliant text as risky due to context misinterpretation.
- **False Negatives**: The tool may fail to catch subtle or novel discriminatory language.

**You should never rely solely on FairProp AI for final publication decisions.**

## 3. User Responsibility
By using this software, you agree that:
1. You are responsible for the final review of all content.
2. You will consult with a qualified attorney or fair housing professional for specific legal guidance.
3. You assume all liability for any actions taken based on the tool's output.

## 4. No Attorney-Client Relationship
Use of FairProp AI does not create an attorney-client relationship between you and the developers, contributors, or maintainers of this project.

## 5. Jurisdiction
Compliance rules are based on publicly available guidelines (e.g., HUD advertising memos) but may not reflect the most recent local case law or legislative changes. Coverage usage is "as-is" without warranty.
