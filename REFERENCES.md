# Architectural References & Credits

## Core Inspiration
The neural classification layer of FairProp is architecturally derived from Zillow Group's Fair Housing Guardrail (released May 2024).

## Legal Basis
Rule-based filtering is grounded in HUD's 2024 Advertising Guidelines.

## Methodology
FairProp extends Zillow's model-only approach by adding a 'Neuro-Symbolic' framework, making it accessible via API and CLI for the broader developer community.
